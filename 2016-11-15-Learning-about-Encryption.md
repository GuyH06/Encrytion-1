    <td>Encryption is a brand new topic that I never study before, and we didn't have much lesson time to focus on it either as most of it was spent looking at our previous projects. I learned almost everything I do about encryption from the homework as we were tasked to create a presentation on it. Researching was key here as most of us knew very little about encryption so we had to do a lot of it. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Being a task set solely for homework, and one I knew little about, research and the amount of it you did, was key to having a good understanding of the task and a good quality of homework. The more research you did and time you put into it the better it was and the more you understood the topic.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As usual, when having tasks that are set for home are best to be done soon after they are set so information from that lesson isn’t lost to the powers of time. I didn’t do it straight after it was set so I could have done it earlier. This would have improved my learning as I would have had more information to help me with my homework improving the quality.</td>
